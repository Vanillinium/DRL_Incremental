# DRL_Incremental
 
A game project for my Advanced Programming class.
--------------------

v0.3.1:
- Added <Decaying> debuff.
After 10 seconds, if there are no inputs, decrease DRL.
- Added failing condition:
If DRL stays before 70 for longer than 10 seconds, force quit the game.


In this game, you have to grind for DRL and strive for the scholarship! The more you click, the more DRL you will get!

How to play: Click on the gray box. Each click grants 1 DRL.

TODO: More upgrades. <Overload> debuff. Proper MENU and GAME OVER screen.
prolly file saving...
