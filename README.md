# DRL_Incremental
 
A game project for my Advanced Programming class.
--------------------

v0.3: Added text box.
Accidentally skipped v0.2.

In this game, you have to grind for DRL and strive for the scholarship! The more you click, the more DRL you will get!

How to play: Click on the gray box. Each click grants 1 DRL.

TODO: Fail condition. More upgrades.
